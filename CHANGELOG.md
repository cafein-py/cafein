## Unreleased

- Packaging: include the `LICENSE` file in the source distribution.
  maturin records `License-File: LICENSE` in the metadata but omits the
  file from the sdist for a workspace-member manifest, which PyPI
  rejects on upload; the 0.1.0 sdist could not be published as a result.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-03

The first release: public-transport routing from GTFS and OpenStreetMap
data with per-leg distances, distance provenance, and carbon emissions —
no JVM, no Rust toolchain required by users.

- GTFS ingest and network model: zip or directory feeds, multi-feed
  merging with feed-qualified identifiers, service-calendar resolution,
  data-quality quarantine with warnings, and a CSR timetable with FIFO
  pattern splitting (`cafein-gtfs`, `cafein-core`).
- Routing: RAPTOR earliest-arrival journeys between stops with journey
  reconstruction (`route_between_stops`), Pareto sets over arrival time
  and number of rides.
- One-to-all travel times: `travel_times_from_stop` returns the earliest
  arrival at every reachable stop from one RAPTOR run — the matrix
  primitive — and `scripts/benchmark_vs_r5py.py` benchmarks all-to-all
  stop-to-stop matrices against r5py (speed and peak memory).

- Emissions: `cafein.emissions` computes per-leg and per-journey CO₂e
  from the installed distances through a most-specific-wins factor
  ladder (trip > route > agency + mode > mode > global default), with
  shipped ITF life-cycle defaults, LCA component columns, user tables
  from DataFrame/CSV/JSON/YAML (PyYAML via the optional `yaml` extra),
  and `TransportNetwork.annotate_emissions`; networks expose `routes`.

- Per-leg travel distances with provenance: `cafein.geometry.trip_distances`
  runs the distance fallback ladder over the feeds (validated
  `shape_dist_traveled` with unit correction; stops linear-referenced onto
  shape geometries; crow-fly with mode detour coefficients as the last
  resort). `TransportNetwork.from_gtfs` installs the distances by default,
  and transit legs report `distance` (meters) and `distance_provenance`.

- Range queries (rRAPTOR): `route_between_stops` accepts a `window`
  argument and profiles all departures within it — one RAPTOR pass per
  candidate departure in decreasing order, reusing labels — returning the
  Pareto set of journeys over (departure, arrival, rides).

- Street-network build: `cafein.streets.walking_footpaths` precomputes
  transitively closed stop-to-stop walking transfers from an OpenStreetMap
  extract (pyrosm walking network, nearest-edge stop snapping with edge
  splitting, cutoff-bounded Dijkstra). `TransportNetwork.from_gtfs` accepts
  an `osm_pbf` argument to route with those transfers, and networks expose
  `stops`, `set_transfers`, and `transfer_count`.
