# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Per-leg travel distances with provenance: `cafein.geometry.trip_distances`
  runs the distance fallback ladder over the feeds (validated
  `shape_dist_traveled` with unit correction; stops linear-referenced onto
  shape geometries; crow-fly with mode detour coefficients as the last
  resort). `TransportNetwork.from_gtfs` installs the distances by default,
  and transit legs report `distance` (meters) and `distance_provenance`.

- Range queries (rRAPTOR): `route_between_stops` accepts a `window`
  argument and profiles all departures within it — one RAPTOR pass per
  candidate departure in decreasing order, reusing labels — returning the
  Pareto set of journeys over (departure, arrival, rides).

- Street-network build: `cafein.streets.walking_footpaths` precomputes
  transitively closed stop-to-stop walking transfers from an OpenStreetMap
  extract (pyrosm walking network, nearest-edge stop snapping with edge
  splitting, cutoff-bounded Dijkstra). `TransportNetwork.from_gtfs` accepts
  an `osm_pbf` argument to route with those transfers, and networks expose
  `stops`, `set_transfers`, and `transfer_count`.
