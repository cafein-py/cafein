# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Door-to-door routing: `TransportNetwork.route_between_coordinates`
  routes between arbitrary coordinates — street access/egress searches
  at both ends feed the transit router, for single departures and
  departure windows alike, and access/egress legs report their exact
  walked street-path distance. `travel_times_from_coordinate` is the
  matrix primitive for coordinate origins: walking access seeds one
  RAPTOR run that serves all destinations.

- Transfer legs report their walking distance: footpaths now carry
  their street-path meters (`walking_footpaths` emits
  ``(from, to, seconds, meters)`` edges), completing per-leg distances
  across every leg type.

- Query-time street access/egress: networks built with an OSM extract
  now carry the walking street network (a CSR graph with an R*-tree
  spatial index in the Rust core), and `TransportNetwork.access_stops(lat, lon)`
  snaps a coordinate onto it and returns walking seconds to every
  transit stop reachable within a cutoff — the search door-to-door
  routing builds on.

- Packaging: include the `LICENSE` file in the source distribution.
  maturin records `License-File: LICENSE` in the metadata but omits the
  file from the sdist for a workspace-member manifest, which PyPI
  rejects on upload; the 0.1.0 sdist could not be published as a result.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-03

The first release: public-transport routing from GTFS and OpenStreetMap
data with per-leg distances, distance provenance, and carbon emissions —
no JVM, no Rust toolchain required by users.

- GTFS ingest and network model: zip or directory feeds, multi-feed
  merging with feed-qualified identifiers, service-calendar resolution,
  data-quality quarantine with warnings, and a CSR timetable with FIFO
  pattern splitting (`cafein-gtfs`, `cafein-core`).
- Routing: RAPTOR earliest-arrival journeys between stops with journey
  reconstruction (`route_between_stops`), Pareto sets over arrival time
  and number of rides.
- One-to-all travel times: `travel_times_from_stop` returns the earliest
  arrival at every reachable stop from one RAPTOR run — the matrix
  primitive — and `scripts/benchmark_vs_r5py.py` benchmarks all-to-all
  stop-to-stop matrices against r5py (speed and peak memory).

- Emissions: `cafein.emissions` computes per-leg and per-journey CO₂e
  from the installed distances through a most-specific-wins factor
  ladder (trip > route > agency + mode > mode > global default), with
  shipped ITF life-cycle defaults, LCA component columns, user tables
  from DataFrame/CSV/JSON/YAML (PyYAML via the optional `yaml` extra),
  and `TransportNetwork.annotate_emissions`; networks expose `routes`.

- Per-leg travel distances with provenance: `cafein.geometry.trip_distances`
  runs the distance fallback ladder over the feeds (validated
  `shape_dist_traveled` with unit correction; stops linear-referenced onto
  shape geometries; crow-fly with mode detour coefficients as the last
  resort). `TransportNetwork.from_gtfs` installs the distances by default,
  and transit legs report `distance` (meters) and `distance_provenance`.

- Range queries (rRAPTOR): `route_between_stops` accepts a `window`
  argument and profiles all departures within it — one RAPTOR pass per
  candidate departure in decreasing order, reusing labels — returning the
  Pareto set of journeys over (departure, arrival, rides).

- Street-network build: `cafein.streets.walking_footpaths` precomputes
  transitively closed stop-to-stop walking transfers from an OpenStreetMap
  extract (pyrosm walking network, nearest-edge stop snapping with edge
  splitting, cutoff-bounded Dijkstra). `TransportNetwork.from_gtfs` accepts
  an `osm_pbf` argument to route with those transfers, and networks expose
  `stops`, `set_transfers`, and `transfer_count`.
